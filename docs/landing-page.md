## What This Course is About

This course is the second in a series of courses about Linux technologies

- OSL640 taught you to be a Linux user. **In OSL740, you will move from being a Linux user to being a Linux system administrator.**
- As a system administrator, you will be responsible for installing, configuring, adjusting, maintaining, and troubleshooting the operation of computer systems. This is a lot of responsibility, and with that responsibility comes power. You will be able to change anything on the system, and you will also have the ability to damage or destroy the system.
- In addition to manually configuring machines, you will learn to use automation tools to "deploy" changes to multiple systems within our organization. Although this course will not cover the full features of these tools, it will serve as an introduction to scripting and automation to make you a more capable and efficient system administrator.
- In this course you will use an external SSD drive (USB 3) with the lab computers on campus to set up a Linux system.
- Alternatively you can use your own computer to complete the labs providing it meets the hardware requirements.
- You will also set up at least four additional Linux systems using "Virtual Machines", and therefore gain experience with different types of system configurations as well as setting up networking between systems.
- The next course in the stream (OSL840) will expand on what you learn here and teach you to administer Linux servers (web servers, DNS servers, FTP servers, file sharing servers) in a cloud environment.

## Learning by Doing

Most of the learning in this course occurs through the hands-on problem solving that takes place in the eight labs and two assignments.

## Requirements for Success:

- It is very important to stay up-to-date with the coursework, and to practice until you have confidently mastered each task.
- All of the software used in this course is open source software, so you are free to use, modify, and redistribute it. This means that you can install it as many times as you want on as many different computers as you would like. It also means that you can tinker with it -- you can take it apart, see how it works, and put it back together in the same or a different way, limited only by your time and ambition. You are encouraged to experiment and question liberally.
- You should take good notes as you learn new concepts, commands, and the configuration changes that you will make during the labs and assignments. Your Professor will provide more instructions regarding the "Lab Log Book"
- You are encouraged to experiment and explore. There is so much to learn about Linux and Open Source Software if you are prepared to immerse yourself. Feel free to setup other VM's to experiment with.
- Carefully read ALL lab instructions and check your work regularly. The labs have been designed with backup safeguards to prevent the student from losing their work. On the other hand, students may lose their work if they fail to follow lab instructions or accidentally forget their ssd devices in the Lab!
